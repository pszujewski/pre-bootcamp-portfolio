Remote repository for FCC portfolio project
This project aims to showcase the projects I've worked on as a part of the Free Code Camp Curriculum. Six projects are availble
and can be found in the apps folder. They include the four FCC Advanced Front-End Projects: Javascript Calculator, Pomodoro Timer,
Tic-Tac-Toe one and two player game, and the Simon Game. They also include two of the four FCC API projects: The weather app and the 
Twich.tv Streamer project.
